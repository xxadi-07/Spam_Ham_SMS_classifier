Spam_Ham_SMS_Classifier is an AI/ML project designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham. The project begins with data cleaning to preprocess and organize the dataset for accurate analysis. After preparing the data, a classification model is trained to distinguish between spam and ham messages. The effectiveness of the model is then evaluated by checking its accuracy and assessing its predictions against the test data. This project combines data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and performance evaluation techniques to create a reliable SMS classifier that can effectively filter out unwanted spam messages from legitimate communications.
